# Task-Management-Collaboration-Tool
Welcome Coders!
I have made this project using html,css and javascript.
this webite is a part of project work and using this websites you can create accounts of a team. Upon logging in, you can add tasks in the TODO list and subsequeny chat with the other team members and also add a timer for your work.To store data, I have used the local storage of the browser thus it requires a little setup of values in the application tab of local storage to work properly.

Setup:
Initialize the local storage with the following values:-
Key                  >Value;
email_data           >[];
name_data            >[];
current_user_data    >{};
chat_messages        >[];
todo                 >[];
done                 >[];
time_value           >[]
